The HTTPRequest_BSD class simplifys making a HTTP request on the ESP.

Important:
I made this code while not knowing there was a esp-idf sollution for doing http(s) request.
So when i found out i already wasted some time making this code and understanding BSD.
I came to the conclusion its more logical to use the esp-idf sollution as its proberly more common, stable, and maintainable.
So i stopped developing this. 
But i am proud of the code i made and still want to show the knowledge i gained.
